Hello! My name is John Boyd. I am an electrical engineer by trade and a hacker at heart. I worked in the semiconductor industry for a few years as an analog & mixed signal design engineer, but lately my career has followed my passion for embedded systems design. I now work as CTO and lead hardware engineer at <a href="https://www.knocki.com/" target="_blank">Knocki</a>, a fun startup trying new ideas in the IoT space.

I have created this blog as a place to document my journies through technology development and hardware hacking. I am not sure what projects will make it into this blog, but any of the following subjects are likely to make an appearance:

* Embedded Systems Design
  * Using C/C++ or Rust
  * For ARM, MSP430, Atmel/AVR, and other MCUs
* PCB Design, Schematic Capture, Layout & Fabrication
* Machine Learning
* Signal Processing (analog, digital & mixed)
* VLSI Design
* Reverse Engineering
* Mathematics
* 3D Printing

I hope you enjoy these projects as much as I do!
