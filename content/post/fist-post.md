# Hello, world!
Hey there! Welcome to my blog, where I will be documenting my projects. I am an electrical engineer by trade, so many of my projects will involve hacking together electronic gadgets, but I also have a wide array of interests ranging from rock climbing to RC aircraft, which may also make an appearance on this blog.

I have recently spent a bit of time improving my online presence. Given this, it's only fitting that this first post be a short log to document my experience setting up this blog and my [resume website](http://resume.johnboyd.io). I plan to get some more interesting projects posted here in the near future :)
